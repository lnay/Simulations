# History

This is a collection of molecule simulations
Written for a science fair project in 2013, only still exists for nostalgia reasons.

# Setup

Requires python 3 with pip, install dependencies with:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run

For the NaCl simulation run:
```
python3 NaCl_Simulation.py
```
For the H2O simulation run:
```
python3 H2O_Simulation.py
```

In both cases, a new window opens with graphics. Up arrow increases kinetic energy, down reduces, and right arrow removes all kinetic energy.
